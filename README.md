# Obsidian "No Dupe Leaves" Plugin

![Custom badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fscambier.xyz%2Fobsidian-endpoints%2Fno-dupe-leaves.json)

> Automatically switch the focus to open notes instead of reopening them

[The discussion that led to this plugin's creation](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/ide-style-navigation-tab-reuse-on-link-opening-tab-management/46671/2).

Obsidian's default behavior is to replace the old note `A` with the new note `B` when you open it,
_even if `B` is already open in another pane_, leading you to have 2 instances of `B`.

This plugin will avoid opening duplicates when possible, while still respecting all "force open in a new pane" instructions (e.g. middle click on a link).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Word of warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è This plugin modifies the default behavior of Obsidian.

Internally, it overwrites the public function `openLinkText()`, which is called when you click on a link in a note. This also affects other plugins that use this function - like Omnisearch -, but does not work on core features like the File Explorer.

Add your input the the [original feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/ide-style-navigation-tab-reuse-on-link-opening-tab-management/46671) to tell Obsidian that you'd like this behavior as the default :)

## Contributing

As this is a quick hack over the default behavior, no feature request will be considered. You can submit PRs for bugfixes.
